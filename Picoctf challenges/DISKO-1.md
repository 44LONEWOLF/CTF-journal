This challenge is all about file compressing system called gzip and a file type called .dd

The compressing system in this situation is called gzip. If you want more info on this click the following link [www.heatware.net/linux/gzip-compress-decompress/]

After you read it, you will have a good understanding on gzip, bzip2 and xz file compression systems

The challenge tells you to download a .dd.gz file and then find the flag.

There are multiple ways to approach this.

first download the file using ```wget```

The first approach, you first decompress the file and then search the flag: 

              ✅ And then decompress it using ``` gzip -d file.dd.gz ``` (file.dd.gz is the file you downloaded previously)
              
              ✅  And then use  ``` strings file.dd | grep picoCTF{ ```  to get the flag (file.dd being the file you decompressed)
              
              ✅  There is your flag

The second approach is a little easier, as you do not have to decompress it first: 

              ✅  After downloading, input this  ``` zcat file.dd.gz | strings | grep picoCTF{ ``` this will let you get the flag without decompressing the file (file.dd.gz being a file you downloaded but not decompressed)

The third approach is when you do not know the flag for sure so you just look for possible clues, which in this very challenge I dont recommend because there is a lot of outputs. But it is very helpful in the real world scenario:

                ✅  ``` zcat image.dd.gz | strings | grep -E 'CTF|flag|bash|cmd|payload' ``` 


###  While streaming with zcat is quicker, decompressing with gzip can be more flexible for deeper analysis. Each method has its strengths, and knowing when to use which is key in CTFs and forensic investigations.
