 PIE TIME (Simplified Walkthrough)


1. Find the offset between main and win using objdump:

objdump -d pietime | grep '<main>'
objdump -d pietime | grep '<win>'

- Then you go to [www.calculator.net/hex-calculator.html] and sutruct the second output from the first. That is your offset 

2. Find the win address

- You'll get a command on your mission (something like  nc rescued-float.picoctf.net 60832), you enter that.
- Then you get something like this ```Address of main: 0x5f6d0520a33d``` and it will ask you your input
- You go to [www.calculator.net/hex-calculator.html] again and subtruct your offset from the Address of main (exclude the 0x part)
- You, now, copy that and paste it as your input
âœ…CONGRATULATION You have found the flag
