There are a couple of ways to capture this flag. 

1. You can use developer tools on your browser and if you expand the tags, you'll find the flag. You can also watch this [walk through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqWbHrm3ECY)

2. You can also use the webshell, it just needs some work. Which is printing and cleaning up the output.

  - Run ``` curl <URL> ``` But as you might see, it's a little difficult to read.
  
  - Instead, run ``` curl <URL> | python3 -c "import sys;  from bs4 import BeautifulSoup; print(BeautifulSoup(sys.stdin.read(), 'html.parser').prettify())" | grep 'picoCTF' ```

Where,  ```curl <URL>``` : prints the webpage,  ```python3 -c``` : execute a python script, 

```import sys; from bs4 import BeautifulSoup;``` : import the necessary libraries,

```print(BeautifulSoup(sys.stdin.read(), 'html.parser').prettify())``` :  print the webpage in a readable and organized way,

```grep 'picoCTF{'``` : we use the grep to print what we want to see, in this case, the flag.


**In a nutshell, the flag’s chillin’ in the HTML. You just gotta un-minify the mess and sniff it out.**
