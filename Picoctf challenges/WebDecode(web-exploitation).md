This one is not too complicated.

Be on the "About" page and Right click -> inspect : And in front of you, you see <img width="1070" height="350" alt="{CC25327E-E629-4DD6-B6EC-058EF6CED35E}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45d6418c-4852-47e7-a9ea-b48a181262ca" />

You see the random looking thing after 'notify_true'? It's Base64. It uses letters, numbers, +, / and it's almost readable i.e, Base64.

You go here [ https://cyberchef.org/ ] and decode it.

Or, if you are like me, you can automate it using:

```

import base64

encrypted = "cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMDJjZGNiNTl9"
decrypted = base64.b64decode(encrypted).decode()
print(decrypted)

```

### This challenge teaches you to pay attention to the HTML page(especially the "About me" part), You’ll get stuck if you skim. Inspect deeply. And yeah — hints exist for a reason
