I just wrapped up SQL injection module from [PortSwigger's Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-paths/sql-injection). And I am so excited to share my experience.

So, SQL injection is one of top 10 OWASP vulnerabilities. And it's been on top of the list for a long time, which tells us
how powerful, versatile and still widely exploitable it is.

The labs on the SQL injection module cover the variations of this vulnerability in different contexts including
Detection, UNION attacks, Blind injections, out-of-band(OAST) exploitation. 

My write-ups talk about these labs. Like, the title, goal, vulnerability location, payload used, the steps for the execution, the result and the takeaway.

I will also share my personal experience, where I struggled the most and the overall impression of the lab.

Let's dive in.
