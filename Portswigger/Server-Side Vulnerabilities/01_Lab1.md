* Title: File path traversal, simple case

* Payload Used: ```../../../etc/passwd```

* Vulnerabilty Location: The filename parameter

* Steps:

  1. Right click on one of the images in the website -> click on _Open image on new tab_ -> Use Burp Suite to intercept it -> Send it to repeater.
 
  2. You can see the _filename_ parameter  on the header. It's something like ```GET /image?filename=10.jpg```.
 
  3. Now we replace the ```10.jpg``` by ``` ../../../etc/passwd ```. Congratulations, you solved the first lab.

* Explanation:

  - When you open the image on the browser, we can see _.../image?filename=10.jpg_. It means that it's selecting a file, which in this case is _10.jpg_.
 
  - But what if we can manipulate it to open another (unintended) file. And that's what we're doing. Since it's a linux server, the passwords are
    stored in ```/etc/passwd``` which is located in the root folder (it could also be a windows server so you'll have to be adaptable). And in this example, the image files are stored in _~/var/www/images/10.jpg_. so currently we're
    in _images_ directory. To go up one level we input ```../``` we're now in _www_ directory. And then ```../```, we're in _var_ directory. Add another ```../```, we're in
    the _root_ folder. After, we add the ```/etc/passwd```, we can see what is in that folder.

* Takeaway: If the app doesnâ€™t lock down file paths, you can sneak out of the image folder and peek at sensitive stuff like /etc/passwd.
