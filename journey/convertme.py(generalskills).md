Alright, for this challenge, we just download the python script. You’ll get a script called convertme.py.

Run it using:
```
    python3 convertme.py
```
It’ll ask something like:

If 48 is in decimal base, what is it in binary base?

Use an online converter or calculator to convert the number to binary. In this case:

48 → binary = 110000

Type that in as your answer and you’ll get the flag.
